## Memory Address

Whe dealing with 80x86 microprocessors, we have to distinguish three kinds of addresses:
1. Logical address
Included in the machine language instructions to specify the address of an operand or of an instruction. Each logical address consists of a segment and an offset (or displacement) that denotes the distance from the start of the segment to the actual address.
2. Linear address (also known as virtual address)
A single 32-bit unsigned integer that can be used to address up to 4GB. Linear addresses are usually represented in hexadecimal notation; their values range from 0x00000000 to 0xffffffff.
3. Physical address
Used to address memory cells in memory chips. They correspond to the electrical signals sent along the address pins of the microprocessor to the memory bus.
